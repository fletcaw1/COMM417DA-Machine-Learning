# COMM417DA-Machine-Learning
Code for module COMM417DA - Machine Learning coursework covering classification, reconstruction and detection.

---

This repository contains two main notebooks: 

- *COMM417DA_Coursework* which contains most of the work.
- *COMM417DA_MaskedFace_Detection_Training* which trains and saves the masked face detection model.

We note that the training notebook is computationally expensive and will likely require you to run on GPU runtime.

In development this was done using Google Colab.
